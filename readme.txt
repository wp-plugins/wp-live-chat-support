= 30 second live chat installation =

Our live chat plugin instantly gives you the ability to chat directly with potential clients and/or website visitors when they're ready to do so. Initiate a live chat with a certain visitor or wait for them to initiate a live chat with you. Increase your website conversion rates by providing real time live support.

= Quick Overview =

Once the live chat plugin is activated, click on "Live Chat" in the left menu navigation. As soon as a visitor lands on your website, their details will be displayed in the live chat control panel. A live chat box will be displayed on their screen. If they fill out their details and click "Start chat", a ringing sound will trigger in your live chat control panel. Once you accept the chat, you can communicate directly with your visitor.

= Using WP Live Chat Support effectively on your website =
One of the most important tasks of your website is to educate potential customers of your product and/or service. By having a live chat window on your website, this gives you the opportunity to do this.

* Live chat is convenient for customers
* Live chat builds trust with your potential customers
* Increase sales by using live chat
* Take advantage of a fully functional live chat plugin for free. Get Pro features for only $29.95!

= Have the choice to use your website or our server to host your live chat =

You now have the choice to host your live chat on either your own website (using your own resources) or our live chat server (using our resources). Making use of our live chat server will improve your chat's performance by up to 300% and reduce the load on your host. Although we initially built our live chat plugin to be used on your own website and for you to host your own live chat server, we now offer you the ability to make use of an offsite live chat server - this is perfect for users that are on low-level hosting packages, or users that are more concerned about live chat performance and chat security.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the live chat plugin, now what? =
Once installed and activated, a link should appear in your left navigation panel within your WP-ADMIN section. Click on the "Live Chat" link and follow the on screen instructions.

= Where can I find documentation for WP Live Chat Support? =
Please review the live chat documentation on [our website](http://wp-livechat.com/documentation/).

= Does WP Live Chat Support connect to a third party server? =
No. WP Live Chat Support was developed to specifically create and manage live chats on your server. Installing this plugin will essentially turn your website into it's own live chat server. We have put every effort into making this process as smooth as possible while ensuring low resource usage on your host. We have incorporated long polling into the live chat functionality which ensures a quick chat response time between the admin and the user while maintaining a low resource footprint.

= What are desktop notifications? =
Desktop notifications are notifications that will appear on the bottom right of your screen when a new live chat is received. This feature is supported in all browsers except Internet Explorer.

= Can my visitors start a live chat without entering their name and email address? =
Yes. This option is available on the live chat settings page.

= Can I disable the live chat window on mobile devices? =
Yes. You can show or hide the live chat window on mobile devices. This includes mobile phones and tablets.

= How does WP Live Chat Support notify me of an incoming live chat? =
You will be notificed of a new live chat by means of email, audio and desktop notifications.

= Can I show the live chat window to registered users only? =
Yes. You can limit the live chat window to show to users that are registered and logged in to your site. 

= Can I specify a user role to my live chat agent? =
Unfortunately not. The administrator of the site is the default live chat agent. The Pro add-on allows for an unlimited number of live chat agents.

= Can I see if I missed any live chats that I may not have answered in time? =
Yes. To view the list of live chats you missed, go to 'Live Chat' -> 'Missed Chats'

= Troubleshooting =
If you're experiencing issues running WP Live Chat Support, please take note of the following:

- The live chat box will only show up on the front end if you are logged in to your wp-admin section.
- The default delay before the live chat box appears is 10 seconds. You can change this on the settings page.
- If you press the "X" within the live chat window on the front end, a cookie will be set that will stop the chat box from showing for another 24 hours.

If the live chat box still does not appear on your website, please go through the following steps:

- Please ensure your theme's footer.php file has the following line before the closing body tag: <?php wp_footer(); ?>
- Ensure that no other plugins are causing JavaScript errors on your website. This could interfere with the execution of our plugin's JavaScript.
- If you need more help, please use the [support forum](http://wp-livechat.com/forums/forum/support/) or contact us and we'll get to the bottom of the problem as soon as possible!
